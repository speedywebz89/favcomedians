Quotes from some of the most famous comedians before the cancel culture.
Sometimes ill be out with friends and ill randomly quote things from comedians ive heard before. These are some of my favorite quotes from some of my favorite comedians. Now i can just pull up this simple website and play the quotes for my friends who don't know about these comedians.
I started by creating multiple variables.
Then i added an eventListener
I used a for Loop to loop through all of the buttons in the HTML  incrementing by 1 until the end of my buttons.
Then instead of writing a bunch of IF/ELSE statements, i simply used a switch statement for the audio defaulting to console.log if any problems occur.
I hope you enjoy the site as much as i do, thanks for looking!
